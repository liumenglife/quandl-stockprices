# Stock Prices via Quand API

This is *Matteo Casadei* milestone project aimed at showing what was learned from the 12-day course taken as 
preliminary step for *Data Incubator 2018's summer session*.

By exploiting several technologies, such as Flask, JSON, Pandas,
Requests, Heroku, GIT, Bokeh for visualization and leveraging on the 
*QUANDL public API* to access data related to US stock marker, we devised a lightweight 
Web app to show the trend of several price measures for any available US stock ticker.

The running app can be found at [https://tdi-stockprices.herokuapp.com](https://tdi-stockprices.herokuapp.com).
